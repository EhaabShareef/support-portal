Review the current structure of **department groups**, **departments**, **roles**, and **users** in the project. Based on the attached reference data, you are to reset and rebuild this structure from scratch (unless the current structure is already fully compatible and solid). If needed, modify the migrations, models, and relationships to ensure correctness and flexibility going forward.

The tasks are:

1. **Clear existing data** related to:

   * Users
   * Roles
   * Permissions
   * Departments
   * Department groups
     You can truncate relevant tables or recreate them as needed.

2. **Create department groups and departments** according to the following structure:

   * `Admin`: admin, Finance, Human Resource, Project Manage, Sales
   * `PMS`: Opera, Opera Cloud, Vision, R\&A, OXI, Technical
   * `POS`: Simphny, Simphony Cloud, RES 3700, RES 9700, R\&A
   * `MC`: Materials Control, Reporting
   * `BO`: BackOffice
   * `Hardware`: Local, Oracle
   * `Email`: Email Case

3. **Seed one default user per department group** with the following format:

   * Email: `groupname@hospitalitytechnology.com.mv` (e.g. `pms@hospitalitytechnology.com.mv`)
   * Assign that user to the corresponding **department group**
   * Assign role:

     * `admin` for Admin and Email groups
     * `support` for all others

4. **Ensure admin user** (e.g., `superadmin@hospitalitytechnology.com.mv`) is seeded and assigned:

   * Role: `admin`
   * **All available permissions** (full CRUD access on all modules)

5. **Verify and fix relationships**:

   * Ensure that users are properly linked to departments and department groups (one-to-many or many-to-many as required)
   * If the current migration structure doesn’t support this cleanly, update it accordingly

6. **Roles and permissions setup**:

   * Use Spatie’s Laravel Permission package
   * Seed only two roles for now: `admin` and `support`
   * Assign full permissions to `admin` role only during seeding
   * All other roles will be configured later via the admin UI

7. **All changes should be fully seedable**:

   * Update the `DatabaseSeeder.php` to include seeding of:

     * Department groups
     * Departments
     * Roles
     * Permissions
     * Users with proper assignments

Ensure this implementation is clean, maintainable, and matches the domain structure of the application. Everything must work from a fresh migration and seed. This structure will become the base for the permission management and access control system, so correctness is critical.
