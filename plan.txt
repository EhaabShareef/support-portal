# **Instruction Guide — Organization Hardware Module Changes**

## **1. Migration & Database Structure Changes**

* **Remove** the following columns from the `organization_hardware` table:

  * `specifications`
  * `purchase_price`
  * `warranty_start`
  * `warranty_expiration`
  * `status` (ENUM) — *status will now be managed dynamically in **Application Settings***.
  * `custom_fields`
* **Make `hardware_type` dynamic** — hardware types should also be managed from **Application Settings** under a new **Hardware** tab.
* Keep `location`, `last_maintenance`, and `next_maintenance` fields **as they are**, but make them **non-editable** in the Manage Hardware pages.

---

## **2. Business Logic Adjustments**

* **Multiple Hardware per Contract**

  * When creating hardware, allow **one contract to have multiple hardware entries**.
* **Multiple Serial Numbers per Hardware**

  * Each hardware record should support **multiple serial numbers** (up to the quantity specified).
  * Ensure both **create** and **edit** operations support this.

---

## **3. Manage Hardware Page Enhancements**

* Group hardware items **by their type/group** for better readability.
* Add **filter options**:

  * By **contract** (hardware only).
  * By **is\_oracle** contracts (toggle filter).

---

## **4. Hardware Creation Wizard Improvements**

* **Redesign** the wizard to be more user-friendly:

  * Clearly indicate **current step** in the process.
  * Include an **option to cancel** and return to the list page at any time.
  * Match the **styling and layout** with the rest of the application for consistency.
* Ensure **Create Hardware** links to the **latest version** of the hardware wizard.
* For **editing**, use a **simplified form** aligned with the updated field requirements.
