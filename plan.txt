Review the **user profile management** feature in the projectâ€”specifically the functionality for a logged-in user to view and update **their own profile**.

Your tasks:

1. **Profile Update Permissions**

   * Check the profile update logic to ensure it follows **modern security and UX practices**.
   * Define **what fields can and cannot be updated** by the logged-in user (e.g., allow name, password, avatar/photo, contact info, but restrict role changes, organization changes, department assignments, or permission modifications).
   * Ensure email changes, if allowed, are validated and potentially require confirmation before taking effect.
   * Make sure no sensitive fields (e.g., `is_admin`, `role_id`, `permissions`) can be altered directly from this interface.

2. **UI/UX Improvements**

   * Replace the current full-page edit form (if applicable) with a **simple, modern modal** for editing the profile.
   * Make sure this modal includes:

     * Profile picture upload (with preview before saving)
     * Secure password update option (with current password verification)
     * Inline validation for fields
   * Ensure **responsive design** so it works across desktop and mobile.

3. **Navigation Profile Dropdown**

   * Review the profile dropdown in the navigation bar.
   * Fix any issues where **email or username text overflows** outside the container (apply text truncation with ellipsis and tooltip for full email).
   * Ensure dropdown width and alignment are responsive to various screen sizes.

4. **Output & Recommendations**

   * Provide a step-by-step improvement plan:

     * File paths to update
     * Backend changes (validation, security checks, authorization)
     * Frontend changes (modal design, responsive fixes, overflow handling)
   * Include **best practice notes** for profile management and UI consistency.

The end result should be a **secure, user-friendly profile management experience** with a clean and responsive dropdown, and a modern modal for editing user details.
