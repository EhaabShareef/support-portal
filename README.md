## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The Support Portal implements a comprehensive RBAC system using **Spatie Laravel Permission**. This system provides secure, scalable access control with the following features:

### 🔑 **Core Principles**

- **Role-Based**: Permissions are assigned to roles, never directly to users
- **Single Role**: Each user has exactly one role for clarity and simplicity  
- **Module-Based**: Permissions are organized by application modules (Users, Tickets, Organizations, etc.)
- **CRUD Operations**: Standard Create, Read, Update, Delete permissions per module
- **Department Isolation**: Agents are restricted to their assigned department

### 👥 **Default Roles**

| Role | Description | Access Level |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Super Admin** | Full system access with all permissions | System-wide |
| **Admin** | Administrative access to manage users, organizations, and all modules | Organization-wide |
| **Agent** | Support agent with limited access to tickets and operations within their department | Department-limited |
| **Client** | Basic access to create and view tickets and articles | Organization-limited |

### 🛡️ **Permission Modules**

The system organizes permissions into the following modules:

- **Users** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Organizations** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Departments** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Tickets** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Contracts** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Hardware** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Settings** (read, update)
- **Notes** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Messages** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Articles** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Reports** (read)
- **Schedules** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Schedule Event Types** (create, read, update, delete)

### 🎛️ **Management Interface**

- **Role Management**: `/admin/roles` - Create and manage roles with permission grid interface
- **User Management**: `/admin/users` - Manage users and assign roles
- **Permission Grid**: Matrix-style interface for easy role-permission assignment
- **User Permissions View**: See exactly what permissions a user has through their role

### 🔒 **Access Control Features**

- **Department Isolation**: Agents can only access tickets from their assigned department
- **Organization Isolation**: Clients can only access tickets from their organization
- **Automatic Role Assignment**: New users automatically receive "Client" role by default
- **Permission Inheritance**: Users inherit all permissions from their assigned role
- **UI Filtering**: Interface elements are hidden/shown based on user permissions

### 🚀 **Getting Started with RBAC**

1. **Seed Roles & Permissions**: `php artisan db:seed --class=RolePermissionSeeder`
2. **Access Role Management**: Navigate to `/admin/roles` (Admin+ required)
3. **Manage Users**: Navigate to `/admin/users` (Admin+ required)
4. **Create Custom Roles**: Use the permission grid to define new roles
5. **Assign Roles**: Select appropriate roles when creating/editing users

### 🛠️ **Developer Notes**

- Permissions are checked using Spatie's `can()` method: `auth()->user()->can('tickets.create')`
- Role checks use: `auth()->user()->hasRole('Agent')`
- Department restrictions are enforced in Livewire components and policies
- All RBAC logic follows Laravel best practices and integrates seamlessly with the framework
