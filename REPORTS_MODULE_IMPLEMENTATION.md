### 📁 File Structure

```
app/Livewire/Admin/Reports/
├── ReportsDashboard.php          # Main reports dashboard
├── TicketVolumeReport.php        # Ticket volume analysis
└── OrganizationSummaryReport.php # Organization metrics

resources/views/livewire/admin/reports/
├── dashboard.blade.php                    # Dashboard template
├── ticket-volume-report.blade.php        # Ticket report template
└── organization-summary-report.blade.php # Organization template

```

### 🎯 Next Steps for Expansion

To add additional reports:

1. **Create Livewire Component**:
   ```bash
   php artisan make:livewire Admin/Reports/NewReport
   ```

2. **Add Route**:
   ```php
   Route::get('/reports/new-report', NewReport::class)->name('reports.new-report');
   ```

3. **Enable in Dashboard**:
   ```php
   'available' => true // in ReportsDashboard.php
   ```

4. **Follow Existing Patterns**:
   - Admin authorization checks
   - Filter implementation
   - Query optimization
   - Consistent UI/UX

### ✅ Testing & Verification
