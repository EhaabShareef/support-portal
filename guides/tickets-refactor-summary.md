# Tickets Module Refactor Summary

## Key Changes
- Extracted conversation timeline into dedicated Livewire component `ConversationThread` for stable rendering.
- Added `ReplyForm`, `NoteForm`, `QuickActions`, `CloseModal`, and `ReopenModal` components to manage ticket interactions.
- Moved main ticket view to `resources/views/livewire/tickets/view-ticket.blade.php` and wired child components.
- Added UI blade components for conversation items (`reply-bubble`, `note-bubble`, `system-pill`).
- Removed legacy conversation component and old ticket view.

## Events
- Components dispatch `thread:refresh` to `ConversationThread` after replies, notes, closing, or reopening to keep timeline updated without reloads.

## Tests
- Feature and Livewire tests should cover reply refresh, close/reopen messaging, and note visibility (tests not executed in this environment).

## Notes
- Close and reopen actions create system messages and update ticket status.
- Listing and policy adjustments pending further refinement.
