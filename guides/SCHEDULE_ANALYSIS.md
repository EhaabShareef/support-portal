# Schedule Module Review

## 1. Current Structure and Logic

### Data Model
- `schedule_event_types` table stores code, label, color, flags and creator with indexes for active/sort order and code uniqueness.
- `schedules` table links users to event types with single `date` plus `start_date` and `end_date` range fields.
- `Schedule` model exposes relationships to `User` and `ScheduleEventType`, casted date fields and helper scopes for filtering by user, department or date ranges.
- `ScheduleEventType` model manages color parsing (Tailwind class vs hex) and provides ordered active scope plus option helpers.

### Application Logic
- `ScheduleCalendar` Livewire component renders the monthly calendar, applies department group and event type filters, and verifies role-based access for Admins, Super Admins and Clients.
- Overlap prevention and schedule creation/updating handled in `saveScheduleEvent()`.
- `ManageSettings` component manages CRUD for schedule event types.

### UI
- `schedule-calendar.blade.php` contains month navigation, filter dropdowns, user rows grouped by department group and a cell grid with color-coded event badges.
- A modal form allows event creation (and intended editing) with user, event type, date range and remarks fields.
- Navigation link exposes schedule module only to authorized roles.

## 2. Identified Issues

### Data Model / Functional Issues
- **Legacy single-date field**: `schedules` table still requires a `date` column alongside `start_date`/`end_date`, creating potential data inconsistency and complicating unique constraints.
- **Unique constraint mismatch**: uniqueness on `user_id`, `date`, `event_type_id` no longer prevents overlapping ranges or multiple events of different types on same day.
- **No database-level overlap prevention**: overlap checks exist only in application code.
- **Missing cascade rules**: `created_by` on event types/schedules lacks `onDelete` handling.

### Application Logic Issues
- **Incomplete editing/deletion**: Calendar has state for `scheduleEditMode`, but no UI or methods to trigger edit/delete from calendar cells.
- **Heavy in-memory filtering**: `getSchedulesForUserAndDay` filters already-retrieved schedules for every cell, causing potential performance issues with many users or days.
- **Client visibility logic**: Determining a client's accessible users through `department->tickets->organization_id` is inefficient and may exclude users with no tickets yet.

### Validation & Permissions
- **Role checks only in components**: No dedicated policies or gates for schedules or event types, making authorization harder to test and maintain.
- **Event type deletion**: prevents deletion when schedules exist but does not offer soft delete or reassignment option.

### UI/UX Issues
- **No edit/delete controls** in calendar cells; users can't modify existing events easily.
- **"+more" indicator non-interactive**: does not show remaining events.
- **Basic date inputs**: lacks a proper date-range picker for better usability.
- **Color options**: color stored as Tailwind classes; no preview or custom color picker beyond manual class input.
- **Responsiveness concerns**: large tables may overflow vertically and horizontally; mobile experience may be clunky.

### Scalability Concerns
- **Linear table rendering**: loops through all users and days, potentially creating thousands of DOM nodes.
- **No pagination or lazy loading**: high user counts will slow rendering.
- **Filtering in memory**: retrieving all schedules for month and filtering on the client side may degrade with large datasets.

## 3. Potential Improvements & New Features
- Remove legacy `date` column and rely solely on `start_date`/`end_date`; replace unique constraint with range-based constraint or validation.
- Implement database check constraints or trigger to enforce non-overlapping events per user.
- Add edit/delete actions within calendar cells (hover menu or click).
- Replace `getSchedulesForUserAndDay` looping with pre-grouped data structures or query per user to reduce per-cell filtering.
- Introduce policies (`SchedulePolicy`, `ScheduleEventTypePolicy`) for clearer authorization.
- Use a JS date-range picker (e.g., Litepicker) and color picker component for better UX.
- Make "+more" clickable to show a popover with remaining events.
- Support recurring events, user-specific color overrides, and iCal/ICS export for integration with external calendars.
- Optimize client visibility with explicit organization-user relationships instead of ticket-based inference.
- Add pagination or virtual scrolling for user list; limit month range or provide week view for dense schedules.
- Implement API endpoints and caching for schedules to improve loading on large datasets.

## 4. Implementation Guide

### 4.1 Data Model Changes
1. **Drop `date` column and update indexes**
   - Migration: remove `date`, adjust unique constraint to cover `user_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`.
   - Update model casts/fillables accordingly.
2. **Add database overlap protection**
   - Consider a DB trigger or use exclusion constraints (in PostgreSQL) to prevent overlapping ranges.
3. **Cascade rules**
   - Update migrations to specify `->cascadeOnDelete()` for `created_by` foreign keys.

### 4.2 Logic & Performance
1. **Pre-group schedules**
   - In `ScheduleCalendar`, fetch schedules grouped by `user_id` and precompute days to avoid per-cell filtering.
2. **Client organization filtering**
   - Add direct `organization_user` relation; filter via join instead of ticket check.
3. **Introduce policies**
   - Create `SchedulePolicy` and `ScheduleEventTypePolicy`; register in `AuthServiceProvider` and use `authorize` in Livewire methods.

### 4.3 UI/UX Enhancements
1. **Editing & deleting**
   - Add action icons in calendar cells; when clicked, set `scheduleEditMode` and open modal with selected schedule data.
   - Implement `deleteScheduleEvent()` with confirmation.
2. **Date & color pickers**
   - Integrate a date-range picker and Tailwind-compatible color picker in modal forms.
3. **Interactive "more" indicator**
   - Use Alpine popover or modal to show full list of events for a day.
4. **Responsive table**
   - Apply sticky headers/columns (already present) and explore virtual scrolling for large datasets.

### 4.4 Feature Extensions
1. **Recurring events**
   - Add fields for recurrence pattern; generate child schedule entries or store recurrence rules.
2. **User color overrides**
   - Allow per-user color customization stored on schedule or user profile.
3. **iCal export**
   - Create endpoint exporting monthly schedules to .ics format for selected users.
4. **Scalability optimizations**
   - Introduce API-based infinite scroll or pagination; cache schedule queries.

These steps provide a roadmap for improving the Schedule module's robustness, usability and scalability.
