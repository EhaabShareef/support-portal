# Beta Readiness Report

## Executive Summary
This preliminary audit reviewed configuration scaffolding, routing, models, policies, services, Livewire components, Blade views, and the new dynamic dashboard implementation. Due to missing Composer dependencies and an uninitialized database, full functional and security verification could not be executed. The project contains solid modularization and role-based access patterns but requires further setup and testing before beta release.

**Recommendation:** **No-Go** until dependency installation, database migrations, and automated test suite are operational. Once environment issues are resolved, targeted fixes listed below should be applied.

## Prioritized Issue List

| Priority | Area | File / Lines | Issue | Expected Behavior | Impact | Remediation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Build / CI | n/a | Composer install fails; vendor tree missing | Dependencies should install cleanly for builds and tests | Blocking | Configure network or provide GitHub tokens so `composer install` succeeds; commit `vendor/` to container only for test execution |
| P1 | AuthZ | `app/Livewire/Dashboard.php` L23-37 | Dashboard access aborts if user lacks `dashboard.access` and role permission | Ensure all dashboard routes/components check both base and role-specific permissions | High | Confirm seeder defines matching permissions and add tests for unauthorized access |
| P2 | AuthZ | `app/Livewire/CustomizeDashboard.php` L27-44 | Widgets filtered by `isAccessibleForUser` but lack explicit policy checks | Widgets should verify permissions at server level as well | Medium | Add policy/middleware enforcement for widget updates |
| P2 | DB Seeding | `database/seeders/RolePermissionSeeder.php` L106-157 | Roles `admin`, `support`, `client` created with permissions; no verification for existing roles | Seeder should be idempotent and reconcile drift | Medium | Use `updateOrCreate` and log changes |
| P3 | Dashboard UX | `app/Livewire/Dashboard.php` L43-60 | Widget retrieval does not eager load nested relations, risk of N+1 | Use eager loading for widget-related models | Low | Add `with()` for relations where needed |
| P3 | Tests | n/a | No tests executed; coverage unknown | Automated tests should cover permissions and dashboard behavior | Medium | After fixing dependencies, run `php artisan test` and add missing cases |

## Roles & Permissions Reconciliation
Roles are seeded in `database/seeders/RolePermissionSeeder.php`:

- `admin` – receives all permissions including `dashboard.access` and `dashboard.admin`.
- `support` – basic CRUD plus `dashboard.access` and `dashboard.support`.
- `client` – ticket read/create/update, article read, `dashboard.access`, `dashboard.client`.

These roles correspond to permission checks within `app/Livewire/Dashboard.php` L23-37, which ensures a user holds both `dashboard.access` and a role-specific `dashboard.{role}` permission.

**Database state could not be verified** because migrations and seeds failed to run without Composer dependencies.

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Run `composer install` successfully
- [ ] `php artisan migrate --seed` initializes roles and widgets
- [ ] Dashboard respects `dashboard.access` and `dashboard.{role}`
- [ ] Widget customization persists and respects authorization
- [ ] Schedule editing restricted to admins
- [ ] Reports render paginated results without blocking UI
- [ ] Profile update flow secured with CSRF and validation
- [ ] All pages render in dark mode and on mobile
- [ ] Security headers, CORS, and rate limiting verified
- [ ] Performance budget: <200ms server response for dashboard widgets

## Release Notes Suggestions
- Introduce dynamic dashboard with per-user widget settings and role-based visibility.
- Initial role/permission seeding for `admin`, `support`, and `client` roles.
- New Livewire components for dashboard and customization.

## Rollback Plan
1. Backup database and storage.
2. If deployment fails, restore database backup and previous release tag.
3. Re-run composer install and migrations as needed.

## Post-Release Monitoring Plan
- Monitor application log for authorization or widget errors.
- Track dashboard load times and cache hits.
- Alert on migration failures or missing permissions.
- Review user activity and bug logs for anomalies in first 48h.
