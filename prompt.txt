Create a fully manageable role-permission system using Spatie Laravel Permission where:

Admins can create and manage roles
Admins can define module-based CRUD permissions per role
Permissions are only assigned to roles, never to users
Each user gets a single role
Admins can assign and change roles for users from the manage-users panel
All access control (UI and backend) respects Spatieâ€™s permission checks
Use grid-style permission management in the UI for clarity and scalability
Check existing roles/permissions in DB before adding duplicates
This setup should be fully integrated with Livewire and follow Laravel best practices.
