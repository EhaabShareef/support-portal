Create a Livewire-powered settings page within the admin views where admins can define and manage application-level settings. This page should allow CRUD operations for departments and department groups, enabling the creation, updating, and deletion of these entities. Additionally, provide options to define default values used across the application in various places. Review the database to identify if any relevant settings tables or structures already exist, and integrate them where appropriate to avoid duplication and ensure consistency.
